# HLS Multiview

HLS Multiview is a simple interface for viewing one or more HLS streams. It currently supports either a "one by one" configuration, i.e. a single stream, or a "two by two" configuration of four streams.

It's written in Angular as I plan to add features that will need to make use of Angular's state management and reactivity if I get round to it.

I use this to view CCTV feeds from multiple cameras with the help of [MediaMTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx).
